            <!--Context-->
            <p>
                I actually came to Boston University in the Fall of 2021 on the 6-year Doctorate's of Physical Therapy Track. I thought I wanted to become a doctor with an emphasis on helping athletes, but quickly realized that it wasn't my passion after working at multiple clinics on BU's campus. Therefore, in the Fall of 2023, I switched to Computer Science.

            <p>
                At first, I wasn't sure where I really wanted to take this computer science degree. It was a drastic change, but after taking CS440, I quickly realized I wanted to learn more about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and it's applications in Data Engineering. I am currently taking CS506 where I will be doing exactly that and am excited about where it can take me.

                I've also always been inspired by many different creatives during my lifetime, including a lot of my friends, which has inspired me to tackle Graphic Design and UI/UX. I would love to learn the basics of that and then use the skills from CS391 to be able develop strong Frontend skills.
